# swipeablecard

It contains 20 static cards, you can only swipe horizontally either left or right to move to the next.

There is button RESET. If you want to reset the list just press that, which will again start from 1.

Rewind one by one can be done using REWIND button or swipe towards top from bottom where buttons are displayed.

A counter is shown which display the counter of the cards, once all cards are displayed and the screen become empty it shows 0.

I have used CardStackView library to implement the cards like view.
